# Construction Site Inventory Tracker

## Project Overview

The **Construction Site Inventory Tracker** is an Excel-based tool designed to efficiently manage building materials on a construction site. It tracks stock levels, inflow and outflow of materials, and categorizes items for better management. The dashboard provides key performance indicators (KPIs) and visual indicators for stock status, helping teams monitor inventory in real time.

## Features

- **Track Building Materials:** Manage stock levels of construction materials such as cement, steel, wood, etc.
- **Inflow & Outflow Tracking:** Automatically update inventory quantities based on the inflow (received materials) and outflow (used or removed materials).
- **Stock Category Management:** Categorize inventory into groups (e.g., Cement, Wood, Steel) for better organization.
- **Color-Coded Stock Status:**
  - **Green:** Sufficient stock in inventory.
  - **Yellow:** Stock is below the reorder level.
  - **Red:** Out of stock.
- **Dashboard with KPIs:**
  - **Total Inventory:** Displays the total stock available across all materials.
  - **Inflow (Qty):** Tracks the quantity of materials added to the inventory.
  - **Outflow (Qty):** Tracks the quantity of materials used or removed from the inventory.
  - **Stock Category:** Organizes inventory items into various categories for easier tracking.
- **Reorder Alerts:** Visual alerts highlight when stock is below the reorder level.
- **Inventory Reports:** Generate detailed reports on stock status and usage trends.

## Technologies Used

   - **Total Inventory:** The sum of all stock available.
   - **Inflow (Qty):** The quantity of materials added to the inventory.
   - **Outflow (Qty):** The quantity of materials removed or used.
   - **Stock Category:** Items are categorized for easier management and reporting.
5. **Reorder Alerts:** Automatically highlights items that need to be reordered based on predefined thresholds.
6. **Generate Reports:** Use pivot tables or custom reports to analyze inventory trends, including stock usage and inflow/outflow rates.

## Dashboard Insights

The dashboard provides the following key performance indicators (KPIs):

- **Total Inventory:** Displays the total amount of materials in stock.
- **Inflow (Qty):** Tracks how much stock has been added over time.
- **Outflow (Qty):** Tracks how much stock has been used or removed.
